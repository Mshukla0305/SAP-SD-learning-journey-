## 📌 Topic: Order to Cash (O2C) Process in SAP  

Today, I learned something very important in SAP — the **Order to Cash (O2C) process**.  
This is the full journey of how a company sells its products to customers — from getting an order to finally receiving the payment 💰.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Process  

### 1. Pre-Sales Activities  
This is the starting point. Before any order is made, the company connects with the customer to understand what they want.  

- **Inquiry**: Customer asks for product details or prices  
- **Quotation**: Company shares price and offer details  
- **Contract / Agreement**: Both agree on terms and prices  

➡️ If the customer says *“Yes, I want it!”* — then we move to the next step.

### 2. Sales Order Creation  
The company creates a **Sales Order** in SAP. This order has all the details like:  

- Customer name  
- Product name  
- Quantity  
- Price  
- Delivery date  

📑 This acts as a **digital record** of what the customer has ordered.

### 3. Shipping Process  
The company prepares to send the product. Steps include:  

- Delivery creation  
- Picking the goods from the warehouse  
- Packing and shipment  
- Posting Goods Issue (removing items from stock)  

📉 After goods are sent, the stock quantity reduces in the system automatically.

### 4. Billing  
After shipping, the company creates a **Billing Document** (Invoice).  

- Customer’s account is **debited**  
- Company’s revenue account is **credited**  

---

### 5. Payment  
Finally, the customer pays the bill. Once payment is received:  

- Company’s **cash account increases**  
- Customer’s **receivable balance decreases**  

✅ And that’s the complete **Order to Cash process**!  
From **Order ➡️ Delivery ➡️ Billing ➡️ Payment** — everything is connected and tracked in SAP automatically.
