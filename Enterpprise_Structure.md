## 🏗️ What is Enterprise Structure?

Think of a company like a human body 👤  
Each part plays a role in selling products, earning revenue, and delivering goods.

- **Head** = Company Code (controls everything)
- **Arms** = Sales Organizations (regional selling units)
- **Hands** = Distribution Channels (ways of selling)
- **Fingers** = Divisions (product categories)
- **Heart** = Plant (production/storage)
- **Legs** = Shipping Points (delivery hubs)

👉 Together, these parts form the **Enterprise Structure** in SAP.
